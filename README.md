# Chorus Connector

### Instructions

Chorus Connector is an exciting new product to help lovers of choral music find ensembles. Build an appealing application with the following features, and feel free to add your own creative twists!

Public Functionality:
- view all choruses
- search for choruses near me

Password-Protected Functionality:
- create, view, edit, and delete choruses

`data.json` contains an example data model and sample list of choruses. Feel free to modify any and all of it for your needs. You do not need to build long-term data persistence (it’s ok for everything to refresh on reload), and data can be stored in-memory however you prefer. 
Authentication can be as simple or complex as you feel appropriate for the purposes of this exercise.
Please take no more than 2 hours to develop your solution.

What We’re Looking For:
- does your code run?
- does your product fulfill the core feature requirements?
- is your code well-organized and readable?
- is the UI and UX pleasing?

Optional Considerations (be selective, given the time constraint):
- accessibility
- testing
- input validation

Fork this repository and expand upon it using your preferred folder structure, tooling, packages, libraries, etc.

This template provides a minimal setup for an Angular app. Note that the Angular CLI requires Node.js v14.20+, v16.14+ or v18.10+. To run the app:
```
cd chorus-connector
npm install
ng serve
```
Update this README with anything we should know about your solution (including spin-up and testing instructions, if relevant).

### Notes from Don Livingston
I have created a simple Angular application that meets the requirements of the project. I have used Angular Material for the UI components and have implemented a simple authentication using localStorage. The application is responsive and should work on all devices. 

To run the application, clone the repository and run the same commands as above. The application will be available at http://localhost:4200/.

The admin username is `admin` and the password is `admin`.

Had I more time, I would have implemented the following:
- Unit tests for the components and services
- a better authentication system
- a better crafted UI and interactions

I hope you enjoy the application and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

### Notes on AI/ML
I did use ChatGPT to help plan out the structure of the application and to help me think through the requirements. I did not use it to write any code or to generate any content. I also used Copilot as an aid to help me write code, and to help me think through the structure of the application and to help me write code faster.
